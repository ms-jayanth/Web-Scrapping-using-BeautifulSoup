¬†Alexa cannot hear after she starts playing"
1,Vikas Singh,Not that useful,3.0,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don't have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. ""Alexa please play the flying jat song"". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart!  Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days  I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it's easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime ""Alexa Bulb on"" or ""Alexa bulb off"" voice command doesn't work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly."
2,Sumit,"Echo Dot never plays original songs, (No way to attach Audio Files)",1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



/*Here I'm Uploading video, enjoy*/Most idiotic device I every bought, never play original songs. Always play some or the other remix or instrumental songs.I wish I would have bought Google home or some Bluetooth speakers./*Some attachments after talking to Amazon Echo Dot Executive*/After my above review, Echo Dot representative called me, I'm glad for this.I showed him the issue with song selection but he told me that it is because of library doesn't have songs that I'm selecting and it is better to add gaana.com from alexa app, after following his guidelines, I repeated and recorded issues. Please see the screen shots and listed to audio  for Alexa and have fun (Now I realise amazon review doen't support audio but only video).You can buy this device if you have to have personalised fun in your life. The is not way of attaching Audio files only video so this is again funny, if I wan't to attach some feedback for Alexa why do I need Video :). This is called mismatch in basic requirement.I'll try to get capture view than attach here for same issues added as image. Till than enjoy."
3,Kumar Gautam,Not satisfied with the wipro smart bulb its not changing colour.,1.0,I bought this product to gift some one else and now I come to know that the product (wipro smart bulb) is faulty its not changing color.not satisfied with this deal.
4,One of Amazon loverüé≠,Good Alexa with 'incompatible' smart wiproüí°,4.0,"Alexa is very good but came with defective smart bulb..., took very much time for setting and now Alexa is replying 'device is not compatible'. Now the smart bulb is working as a normal bulb of Rs. 25/-"

¬†It's just amazing. I bought it for my son. And he is loving it like crazy. The perfect smart speaker with reasonable price. Must buy product if you want to buy a smart speaker. And I bought it Ina combo with light. And it's working super fine."

¬†Do not buy this product. When i asked alexa that kashmir is part of which country it said china.Boycott alexa"
7,Monu,Very good product,5.0,Bhut hi Achha hai aur bhut achhe se kam karta hai
8,Thakur Ankur Kumar Pratap singh,I recommend one more accessory,5.0,Its just one if the best deal i ever got on amazon I purchased it with a 12 watt wipro light at 2200 and enjoying it since last 2 daya its my 4th echo device and yes I would highly recommend buying a product with this just search echo dot wall mount you ll see a 800-900 rupees wall mount trust me it will make a huge difference between sound and transportability plus when its on wall if will recognise your voice quicker as it faces you on the wall seriously guys the combination of these two is compulsory
9,Akash singh nishad,No warranty should be given to you so be alert buy on your own risk i try different companies spkr,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Worst experience with alexa no warranty you get with this product.Amazon policy are worst. Ctdi partner an official amazon devices service partner.I have requested to Amazon to replace my alexa device with in the warranty period the refuses my request. issue is escalated bu amazon team but no follow up call can be held till today. They are giving fake excuses for service they are temporary un available for service of alexa after few days the warranty get to expire then they say your product warranty has expired so we did not give you a service for your product. ‚Äú excuse me amazon all of the world wide companies change their policies in national lockdown.‚Äù I think amazon policy are worst. They stand in the last of the top companies list. They have no customer satisfaction. Even apple has extended there warranty of their product in lockdown. Amazon shame Amazon shameful for you"
10,Vijay Kumar,Amazon is selling an experimental product.,1.0,"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account  for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software  and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products."
11,abhiman,"Works wonderfully, Stupidly priced",3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Works beautifully, have bought 3 to link the entire house. Frequently group and play them together, use drop in to create an intercom, and have linked to speakers, bulbs, TV and other gadgets. I would still give this only 3 stars because it is double the rate here in India compared to the US. A country with 25 TIMES India's per capita income. What is this pricing Amazon? I understand there may be taxes in India but still. 2X the price ?This not withstanding will buy a larger Echo speaker whenever there is a sale on Echo with reasonable prices."
12,Jack,Awesome,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Bought this and wipro 9w smart bulb in combo offer. Configured smart bulb in alexa. Cool thats it.Just say ""alexa, lights on"", ""alexa, turn light to red / blue"" etc.. you can alse even change the brightness ""alexa, change the brightness to 50%"" etc. You will get the manual within the wipro bulb box. There you can see the list of commands.Lets see the other options of echo dot. I connected this to home theater. It is just playing songs from any music station, my playlist. Tried these 2 options only. Mostly i play rhymes. Around INR 2500, i got this combo. Worth to play around."
13,Singam,"Loved sound quality, it's awesome",5.0,"I am using alexa dot 2nd Gen and today I have gifted dot 3rd Gen to my Daddy.1. I see of difference in sound quality compared 2nd gen. Sound quality is amazing.2. It is louder than 2nd Gen Dot3. One thing disappointed is that when say 'Alexa, play old telugu songs' in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songs'(not telugu old songs). When I specially say 'Alexa play telugu retro station songs' it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singers.I will update the review after days again but it's 5 star rating for now"
14,ARNPRASAD,Combo with smart bulb reaches US deal price!!!!,5.0,For 2000 using 10% off..you are getting a bulb worth 500...making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA.  So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!!  Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers.  This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness.  While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that.  Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times.  Just grab this before it goes back to its old price.  Even the smart bulb is very helpful.  While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb.  Just go for it before its too late
15,Indrani Das,Value for money smart speaker,5.0,"I was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360¬∞ view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10. Also paid only ‚Çπ1999.What more one can ask for."
16,Amit Sharma,Prompt response and issue solving by Amazon Kudos üôÇüëç,5.0,"""Worst experience brought it on 12th August already stopped working since 25th September @Amazon what should be done suggest""This was my previous review but now i am amazed with customer service i got from Amazon. The adaptor for Alexa was faulty..so after the review Amazon came to know about my problem and without any delay they help me with a new adaptor without any cost.In this way within a day my issue is resolved. Thankyou Mr.Aman for your promp response and solution will never forget it.so all these stars are not for Alexa now but for Amazon üôÇu won my ‚ù§Ô∏è"
17,Santhosh,Alexa Sucks,3.0,"me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I do not know that""me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I could not find that""me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I don't recognize it""search capabilities of Alexa sucks!! Even when I read out the playlist names as they are on Amazon Music, Alexa can't find those playlists. Alexa know a standard playlists like 90s bollywood, bollywood hits etc., If you are looking for Kannada playlists or for that matter any local language lists, Alexa just does not know...me ""Alexa, I have feedback"" ""You really suck!!"""
18,Rahul Dubey,Good Hardware with just okayish software,3.0,"This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)The software front is just average.If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say ""Alexa"" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose."
19,Ritwick Saikia,Hits far above its weight,5.0,"The speaker was larger than I thought it would be, a bit chunky but not too heavy. It doesn't move about, because it's nicely weighted, even if played at full volume though I believe 50-60% volume would be enough for most people. The sound is very good indeed. The Bollywood and dance songs play great and even the rock and metal songs are enjoyable. The bass is not very heavy but the sound seems weighted nice for bass heavy songs. Alexa makes it so easy to do so many things, especially if you have smart appliances and lights and all at home which are compatible. Sone things I find enjoyable are asking Alexa to turn on the tv via my smart plug and play a particular show on the fire tv stick and by the time I get to the living room everything's on and the show's about to start. You can even use it to call your family to dinner if you have two or more echo speakers. Some privacy issues are there but it's up to you how comfortable you are giving up some for the convenience it provides. Playing music, the news, weather updates, traffic updates, reading your Kindle library books to you, the possibilities are endless. Spotify too is very nicely integrated with Alexa. The only downside is that the Google feud means there's no YouTube or YouTube music support officially and you have to run through some hoops to get it working (P.S. look up Paul Hibbert on YouTube [oh the irony]). P.P.S.-Amit Bachchan's voice is now available via Amitji keyword but unfortunately you have to pay extra for it :)"
20,Abhishek Banerjee,A good product for everyday use,3.0,"Well amazon did a great job they explain every pros on their details*Only thing is alexa is in beta stage may be it will take some more years for this AI to work like google assistant, because most of the time alexa says "" ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§ù‡•á ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§™‡§§‡§æ""*Interaction in hindi is better than google assistant*Sould quality is better than my expectations*Got it on amazon GIF with wipro bulb @2300rs with 100 of cashback ‚úåüèª* in winter season i don't need to go out from my quilt to switch of my home devices üòÇüòÇ Thanks amazon* Good for my parents as they can ask most of the things to alexa because they r in a phase of learning smartphones features* Only buy if u heave a wifi router, will not work good with mobile hot-spot* Smart devices most of them only supports 2.4Ghz wifi router* Smart devices cost a lot as compare to normal electronics, with this speaker u need to spend extra bucks to make your home more smarterPS- Add motion sensing LED to ur home with smart LED ... It looks cool and u dont need to shout a lot to turn it off or on and the bottom line is they r more cheaper ‚úåüèª"
21,Jitender,It is fantastic invention.,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Got it with Wipro smart LED bulb bundle. In 1999 both.Pros:Solid build quality.Easy setup.Capture voice even far from 10 feet.Loud and clear sound.Bass is awesome.Easy connection to your smart LED bulb.Capture all voice just anybody called ""Alexa"". It will respond.Cons:No battery inside, you need to put in its power adapter all the time.Works only if active internet connection available.You should have wifi at home to connect all devices together."
22,Amazon Customer,Limited capablity with very poorly designed sensors,1.0,"worst product amazon released into market in a hurry. Here are some, if not all, of the issues:1 - No sound clarity. Even from 4 feet one cant understand what alexa saying. muffled voice2 - Limited capability. Other than weather it doesn't know any significant much. I didnt buy it for weather or switch on a bulb.3 - Dont understand english language properly.4 -Its useless overall for anything and for anyone, be it kids or adults.Amazon has a long way to go before it can make it usefull."
23,Saahil Singh Bains,Worst Integration ever.,1.0,"This device refused to set up because the Alexa app just didn't work on my mother's phone. I had bought this for her. I even tried signing out of the Alexa app on my phone and then tried logging into her account on my phone and as soon as I would log in, the app would go blank.I'm still confident that there is nothing wrong with the Echo device but there is a problem in the Alexa app. More specifically there is a problem with my mother's account on the Alexa app. Unfortunately there is no way to fix this or talk to any kind of customer support. Customer support is a chat bot which has a preset list of questions that you need to select. There is no way to get any support for the app.My suggestion would be to stay away from such 'dumb' smart speakers. Amazon US is very helpful, because the laws in  that country require them to be. Amazon in India sucks when it comes to Alexa app support, because there is no way to talk/ chat to someone who can check the account.Its strange that my worst purchase from Amazon is actually an Amazon product and not something sold by a listed seller."
24,RAVINDRA GOPAL,Average performance,3.0,"I am returning after trying various commands for about a week. This is a recent review.Received only 2 days ago. So initial impressions.Not checked integration. Oakremote that I purchased with Echo was a flop.+ves -Voice recognition , Quick response, Family is having fun giving commands-ves: It generally plays music from Amazon music library. THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD. Sounds like 19th century radio. It works only when Wifi and Electricity are available.I am keeping it for the novelty and as a sample of future AI. Would be happy if it lasted atleast till 2022 Diwaliüòú"
25,Aswini Sahoo,Alexa is great but device needs to be improved,3.0,"I like Alexa and the features. But rated 3 due to the below facts.- No inbuilt battery. A big minus. In today's mobile world, you cannot enforce the device to be plugged in always.- No USB charging facility- Alexa app is horribly slow- The moment your wifi connection changes, it cannot detect. You need to reconfigure itPlus features- Device shape is great- Sound quality is superb- Voice response is awesome"
26,Mohammad Shabeer,Bang on Product for the price!!,5.0,"It‚Äôs an amazing product to have, especially the integration with your google calendar and tons of skills to play around with. Though hoping there will be more better software updates, butIt‚Äôs a bang on product for the price. Bought wipro bulb and echo dot together for 2449Rs and then returned the wipro bulb and got back 700Rs. So got the Alexa for just 1750Rs, which is truely a bang on for a smart assistant and a Bluetooth speaker ;)"
27,TechDevoteeIndia,Fantastic sound quality but alexa is useless,2.0,"In comparison with Google voice assistant devices -1. Eco dot 3 is awesome in hardware - mic recognises voice from far away distance and bass on speaker is super.2. But software experience is pathetic due to alexa which is not even 10% of google assistant. Very limited recognition of command and that too hit or miss by alexa.3. Alexa catches one command unlike combined commands in Google assistant.4. Unproductive things like telling jokes are only features of alexa. It can't even calculate dates.On/off smart plug & reminders are the only perfectly working things with Alexa !!!In layman terms - Google is hero and Alexa is joker.Limitations in speaker -Note that only 3.5mm output is possible, so eco dot 3 can't be used as 3.5mm speaker but can be used as Bluetooth speaker.You can't use mic in Bluetooth mode. So, not usable for calls.Alexa app -is inconsistent and not user-friendly. Critical features like alexa guard are not available in India.Voice recognition -It's always hit or miss with simple commands also.I bought to play online kannada music but voice recognition is limited to Bollywood movie names or artists for Indian music.It won't recognise 99% kannada music/movie/artist names.My VERDICT -Even though I got in DEC 2021 for 2299, I'm finding it useless. My usage is restricted to on/off smart plug at water heater and reminders, as reminders with 5 out 5 times whereas it's 4/5 with Google.Alexa ignored Kannada and all other South Indian languages, so time for us to ignore alexa and go with Google devices if South Indian languages are your need.Don't waste your money on alexa voice assistant devices."
28,Shiv Sharma,Disappointing support for troubleshooting of Echo dot issue,1.0,"The product has intermittent issue while connecting with Phone for playing videos sound.  Spoke with Amazon Tech support, they went ahead with raising replacement after some troubleshooting. Now, they picked the device. Though no replacement update.  Nothing in the app which indicates that the product has been picked up or replacement has been sent.Moreover the device itself dont have connectivity with ZOOM app and for calling  in India. Though the feature is available in other countries through Echo Connect feature.Hope they will sent the replacement."
29,Dharma Sriram,Very bad product.. cracking sound after six maonths of usage.,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I used hardly six months and getting crack sound from speaker. It happened to couple of other friends too. And service is very pathetic. I have booked service and no one called me back. Better to go for Google one which is very reliable. This is not for long term usage. Amazon making fools with duplicate products."
30,Manish Sharma,Gyd audio but really bad and dumb Alexa assistant..Horrible answers..Very Dissatisfied.,1.0,"Alexa is horribly wrong and Dumb..I made a mistake by not buying google mini speaker..Alexa has no answers...It is a stupid speaker..I know u need to enable the skills and all that..However, it is still a very bad Assistant..Fully disssatisfied..Audio quality is good but one can buy a simple bluetooth speaker at 1/3rd the cost rather than messing ur mind up with such an incapable AI speaker.. It cannot answer 90% of your questions.Used with Fireststick: limited usage and that too with limited apps.Will still need the remote anyway. Not much useful with Firestick.I strongly suggest please Buy google home mini instead..Audio may be a bit less but the google assistant is amazing.."
31,Kapil Soni,Could have been better,4.0,"We purchased Gen3.  The voice of assistance is too heavy. No equalizer settings.  App has a very poor design and functionality.  Sound of music is rich, but very poor in high frequency (treble), bass is good as per the size of speaker.  Overall, good to hear music.  AI is just okay, has very limited AI features, Mobile's Google voice is way more intelligent in answering questions.  Good for wakeup alarms and listening music.  Apps like spotify is very poor as opposed to Advertisement shown.  Youtube selects better song lists rather than Amazon's music or Spotify.  Gaana is still better, but way behind Youtube.  Crux: If you have a small and good quality speaker system, just pair with your mobile and it shall be better; more better if use an old phone as no sms & phones shall disturb.  These smart speakers are always listening (except for mute) ... always leaves me in doubt."
32,Ramana Murthy Devulapalli,Keeps shouting the device name it is playing from,2.0,"Everytime I connect to the device it says playing from and mentions my device name. This comes at high volume as this volume can only be controlled through the device. But this doesn't end here. Alexa shouts playing from and my device name everytime. If I lock my system and re-login then it shouts this message. If I stay idle and don't move my mouse for 5 mins and then move it then I get this mesaage again. Sometimes it happens when I am playing videos as well. A video will be playing and suddenly Alexa shouts playing from and my device name. Unfortunately even though I tried many things to get rid of that, I wasn't able to get rid of this sound till now. When I connect to Alexa speaker for the first time it doesn't connect properly and it plays with breaking sounds. This happens many times and I have to keep disconnecting and connecting it back till it works properly. Overall it is a fine speaker but there are too many problems that I face everyday with it."
33,Chakraborty,Total value for money...,5.0,"In a word... Just fabulous...Not that much works in queries like Google. But GK level is quite good.For music it's outstanding.Voice recognition, sound quality, the LED ring ... All experiences are just awesome.Don't know about Home assistance, didn't try but didn't work to call or message on any number. Whom you are calling need to be added with your Alexa Profile. Of course you won't give access to outsiders. It's only use for family members only. So it's not useful that much.But After all these ifs & buts... Me & my family members like it very much.."
34,anirban,poor design thinking and lack of  access restrictions ruins good recognition,2.0,"I bought this as a productivity tool- during the pandemic while I drift between office work and housework, I need something to remind me of upcoming tasks or meetings.  It fails terribly due to lack of  thinking by the designers.1. This devise should require  a password or PIN or recognize the voice of the person before proceeding further.  It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders  or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed. 2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer.  Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results4. The reminders should  have an option to repeat till I turn it off by saying ""acknowledged' or 'done'"
35,Jagdeep Visweswaran,Ambient computing Marvel - Alexa,5.0,"My perception about ambient computing changed after I bought this alexa device and Iam loving this device.Alexa's voice is a bigger USP , such a soothing voiceBest WFH home companionLook up alexa skills and you will be facinated how many thousand skills it has,Check out Alexa skills in amazon website & in alexa mobileAlexa is a platform and Amazon making it better everydayThese are early days of ambient computing and no assistants are perfectYou can use google assistant from ur phone via bluetooth to get essential from google assistantSpeaker Sound quality is decent and won't  hurt your ears.Amazon adding more songs to  Amazon music and if you have prime subscription you are gonna enjoySpotify integration with Alexa is intuitive with free spotify accountWe can set out Alexa routines and blueprint feature is awesomeIOT connectivity  is seemlessAlexa reads news from Ndtv , TOI, ET, and more.Alexa market share is more than google nest,so developers line up for alexa than googleThank you amazon for creating this best Alexa speakerMuch loveAlexa user"
36,Prakash,Overall a OK Smart Speaker,3.0,"This review is after using echo dot gen 3 more than 2 months. While there are both Pros and Cons, this is a good device to enter into connected devices world.Pros:1. Good looking gels nicely with the environment.2. LED ring gets your attention when in need.3. Good sound quality on playback.Cons so far:1. Sound is muffled for the responses from Alexa, you can't make out clearly on what it says most of the time. No fix yet { reduced one star because of this. }. Due to this issues it's being used as just a music player most of the time.2. Compared to Google Mini, Alexa's search contextual hits are lower.3. Was unable to get Follow-up working properly."
37,J pathak,Pathetic,1.0,"A great device to get started, echo dot is a great device to first know your requirement. Alexa is integrated well enough but the voice recognition will give you trouble in later stages as it fails to recognise simple regular commands after a while, you will only see the blue light which after taking no action will turn off and resume the ongoing task. Many times it will disappoint and embarrass you, can only hope it to get better in future.Update:After using it for 1 year i would say it isn't that good of a device, now out of 10 times calling itout, it wouldd hardly respond twice. May be they have made the 4th gen better in this aspect but this device if you're even getting at a discounted price of 1k, don't bother. Not worth your money."
38,Abhishek,The integration with other app is difficult,3.0,"The integration with other app is difficult and many times it unable to perform well with voice recoginitionFlaws:1.Its difficult to pair it with smart switch and bulbs.i was not successful,in doing so2.voice recognition sucks3.the help provided ia not good at all.not a good assistqnt.4.cannot plqy music or video from yputube5.no proper help for automating6.cannot use it as output speaker with my projector7. Simple automation scripts for pairing should be provided as a sample so that ppl can directly reuse them8.it only search songs from limited platforms.that huge disappojntmentNot satisfied at all.Only thing that I like is sound of speaker"
39,Joysurjya Hagjer,A Wonderful Assistant at Your Beck and Call,5.0,"Got a sweet prime day combo deal on this and this is my second purchase of this device. For the price and the ease of use and integration, I am very happy with it. I only wish it had a chargeable feature to go alongside it to make it truly portable but I guess Amazon has other devices which cater to that need.I really haven't used the offerings from google and apple in this category so will not compare but just for itself, this device is a charm."
40,R44,"Decent product, but has many software bugs... Hope they are fixed in the future.",4.0,"Hello,I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or GoogleIf you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference."
41,Mambo,Good Sound Quality.,5.0,"Sound Quality was unexpected from such a small device with a single small speaker. I enjoy FM radio (through skill) everyday. This is very useful as analog FM reception in our area is very bad. Through skills it reminds me of my medication.  Command detection is mostly accurate. But when searching for music, it plays wrong songs at times may be because of the very limited music collection with amazon. Pairing with a second Bluetooth speaker using ""discover"" command is not working unless you remove the already paired device using Alexa app. I wish the alarms and reminders had user programmable/uploadable bells/voices as there is only one sound in the alarm settings."
42,Prasad Shrivatsa,Not for all. Suits teens best.,2.0,"Echo Dot is a good speaker and voice recognition is quite impressive. However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like ""Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki..."" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called ""Ai Watan"" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today's teens. And this won't change.Update: January 10, 2021Almost two years since purchaseThe device is still as good as it was when bought. However, it seems Amazon has made no efforts to improve their music libraries. Their focus is still only to cater to the youth, not those who love soft soulful music. When I ask Alexa to play songs of Md. Rafi, for example, she will only play noisy ones like ""Chaahe koyi mujhe jungle kahe..."". She will never include songs like ""Ik haseen shaam ko dil mera kho gayaa..."" even if the song is available in Amazon Music. The Amazon team thinks only college goers listen to its music. This is one of the reasons why I can not recommend Amazon's voice assisted speakers to friends."
43,KARTHIK S,My first smart speaker,5.0,1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.

¬†Sound quality is good,fast response,easy to use.it is a good product and for those who are not much aware about the technology they can also operate easily.you can listen news and if you are feeling bored alexa can tell you good jokes.i m also using wipro smart bulb with Alexa and it is working awesome.i found only one issue sometimes alexa does not respond I think because when we give command from long distance I mean because of mic but overall good product."
49,POOJAN,Good Product,5.0,"Frankly speaking, I am highly satisfied by the quality of the Echo dot but talking about Bulb it wasn't working perfectly. It wasn't showing all the colors. Thanks to the gentlemen seller He got me my replacement. So I would give an overall 5 stars."
50,KULDEEP,Don't purchase device ......don't waste your money,1.0,This is useless device.0) it is not listening command properly. And we have to speak loudly.1) It is not connecting through Bluetooth to desktop. After a long research and hard setting it is connected and if we would change any song than audio is not coming. I am frustrated.2) Always need connectivity with internet / Bluetooth to operate any device.3) not playing music easily wherever we want.4) don't waste money if don't have 24 hours internet connection and related smart device.5) from desktop PC it is not connecting from cable and even from Bluetooth adaptor.So please please don't waste your money on it.Not a smart device it is useless device.

Finally what I was given is 1600 rupees refund with a sorry message. Ihave lost 1800rupees straight away without even seeing the product.Howmuch every I try to escalate the issue the response will be the same, ""we can't do anything for you and you have to accept whatever happens""Now I'm understanding how corporate bullying works.Please be careful."
52,Criston,Worthy Alexa speaker at the price range I got.,5.0,I got a discount of 1000 for this product during some flash sale and got the product at Rs. 2499. It originally costs 3499. So to buy at this price is a awesome deal. I really appreciate amazon for selling products cheaper than the original cost. These are very friendly and reliable devices that can help you to track any orders or set up an alarm or sing a song on any occasion. Every thing I tried and it works wonder. Definitely a must buy for young people who want to be smart in their day to day activities.

54,C.L. Verma,size to sound ratio is just excellent,5.0,"The size to sound ratio is just excellent, the emphasis seems to be on voice but the base is absent so this is not for the base head.This is the most responsive voice integration that I have seen, as you say, Alexa, it starts listing. There are a lot of things that you can ask Alexa like adding a product in your Amazon cart, open rain sound, play music, set alarm, etc.The interesting thing is that Alexa also listing commands in Hindi as well. This is only a part of the home automation system. All the smart equipment/products you purchase can be connected with Alexa like a light bulb to control it with voice etc. but for that, you need a router in your home.ConclusionThe speaker does not have a battery but he can be connected via Bluetooth from your phone and PC. Which is a good thing but all of a sudden it stops playing for no reason which is very annoying?I got it in INR 2500, at this price you must buy it, just to experience a smart speaker but in INR 3500 it looks a bit expansive. If you decide to buy this then this going to be the first step to transform your home into a smart home."
55,Amazon Customer,Super product,3.0,"Very nice product, this was my first experience with alexa, overall recognisation and sound quality is good , but it is not pairing with my  VU smart TV.Pros:Sound quality was too goodNo lag or delay in responseCons:-Should work with DC power also with battery backup, always we have to connect with AC power.-Without current you can't use this echo dot- listed very few Android TVs (example VU smart tv is not in the list)-Should enhance on 'Schedule to play any song by scheduled time"
56,Sriram,One star for the Hardware and nothing for the Software!,1.0,"Bad software! Alexa is not smart at all.voice recognition is not accurate most of the times but more than that Alexa interpretation leaves lot to be desired. Alexa is a just NLP and works on plain if else or a switch condition rather than being smart device. No where follows the user pattens, voice patterns and the people to come up with suggestions. Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device. Mostly none of the songs I want will be played, I end up using it for casting the music from the phone, which anyways normal Bluetooth speaker will do at a less price.Hardly any useful tricks as they call it!Just works as voice command based device rather than a smart speaker!"
57,Avadh J.,Get hang up suddenly,1.0,"Hi I am using this from the beginning and I have echo 3rd gen ordered from Amazon but nowadays when I uses it, it suddenly gets stop and nothing happens  I have to manually swith off and switch on to resolve the issue, and again it happens please do the needful to help me.."
58,Deepak Agarwal,Somewhat disappointed,3.0,"Excellent service provided by the device.. Only problem is with Eco dot 3rd generation device that it‚Äôs only launch an app but never plays a video, especially YouTube.. This feature is a very basic one and should be added with this device which will enhance the product services overall.. Please take it as a consideration. Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV‚Äôs in a single home.. This should be the minimum. I am very much sure, if these two features could be added with this device, it will enhance the overall service of the product and will reach to many other people in India and thus increase the sale of the product.."
59,George,Expensive Smart Speaker,2.0,"Expensive, Smart speaker works only when plugged in. Bluetooth V2.0 is very old dur to this audio is very poor, sound becomes very low. No battery to support the speaker so if no power you cannot use the device. Sometimes while song change you hear a distorted sound. Not worth the purchase as Bluetooth quality in the speaker is bad. You need to shout then only Alexa can hear you - voice sensor is poor. On full volume Alexa will not recognise your command."
60,k2max6,Too much hype,2.0,"This review is especially for those sitting on the fence .I‚Äôve been using Google Nest and minis and wanted to shift to Echo for its Drop in feature basically .(the full intercom) . It worked fine. But overall Alexa was disappointing. Even after having 4 mics the voice recognition was only a tad better than Google. The sound is natural but artificially natural, a little muffled as well.The app is poor. What takes less than a minute to setup on Google Home it takes over 3-4 minutes on alexa app. I have over 40 smart devices in my home and the time it needed merely setting up those devices was a bummer. Echo or Alexa is is just popular because Amazon sells it while Google devices are not marketed that much."
61,Shafin Muhammed,Feeling shame on Amazon service,1.0,"Feeling pitty on amazon. I have ordered for three product on prime day. But I didn't recieved the product. On the next day itself it says (return recieved) and it was the mistake of courier service and amazon. But when I called the customer service, they ensured me that the placed it again with the same price. But still the status on my dashboard wasn't updated. So I called to customer service again, and he too said same. After 4-5 days I called again, and now they are saying that nothing is updated and I have to place the order again(with today's price). Then what's amazon prime for?! If they can't sell their own product in a wise way.. So disappointing.it was a gift for my brother. And it delayed again. I need a clear action from Amazon service with this matter."
62,Sab,Go for Google home instead,1.0,"Better go for Google home..- cannnot make/accept phone calls (only Alexa calls)- cannot place orders on prime now- connected to Samsung smart TV via smart things skill and it can only do basic control like on/off,volume control.-technical customer care is not that good for any support issue.Free Wipro smart light isn't really smart..once power resumes after a power cut you need to switch it off again via app/Alexa.Only worthy use of echo is unlimited music from Amazon music."
63,Ravi,Alexa with lot of restriction,1.0,"It is useless device and waste of money it only work with registered WiFi with amazon not with in coming signal of the Alexa app computer or mobile , no one else in the house can use it if registered WiFi is not available and at the same time we can not register two ,three signals . Alexa becomes use less when there is no internet , and there are lot of restrictions like hand free not available when in battery saver mode etc etc . at many a times it can not understand your voice and there are many app's missing in window computer .if i instruct it to teach Gramer to children it can not do . what a useless device it is , i even wanted to buy Fire TV stick but lots of them in used market ,hence i thought there must be some problem like this in that also hence stopped its purchase .My advice to Amazon is make it user friendly . do not restrict to one WiFi signal ,Take the in coming signal or allow us to register two ,three signal there should not restrict Hand free etc .With RegardsRavishankar"
64,Anand Singh,In love with it,4.0,"My only disappointment is that it does not have battery and when power goes off it dies.Sound quality is very good, good bass but not like woofer.It can be used as Bluetooth speaker. But not sure if Bluetooth earphones works with it. Will update about it later."
65,Vikram,Not happy with Amazon service,2.0,"I was very excited about this purchase and very happy that I got delivered one day advanced and I tried setting up Alexa but ended up unsuccessful for almost 6 hours. Then decided to call Customer service I requested for call back on 7.05pm evening and I call from them on 7.06pm which was amazing and prompt service. The Agent whom I spoke to was Mr. Sami, he was so polite, professional and spoke to for 45 minutes and finally came to know by the agent that the product which I got was reported as stolen or missing product, So that is why I couldn't complete the set up process. I was completely surprised & confused that how come a very big firm like Amazon can deliver a stolen product to their customers and the agent managed to replaceml the product and he gave me end to end service. I was happy with customers service not with Amazon service"
66,abdul h.,I Love you Alexa,5.0,More effecient AI technology. So nice. You won't feel you are alone. Alexa always with you.Add more AI behaviour depends on your usage.

67,kaivalya,Google home is nothing infront of this,5.0,"So i know why you guys are here for.Omg why should i buy amazon echo instead of google home??So good for you here's the answer.I'll not tell you about things you know and everyone's talking about like it's mic and speakers are awsome, it's very localised etc.I'll tell you why you need this if you want this for home.1. This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot.2. This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phone.(Actually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my roomüòù)3. This has best features for home automations that google home or any other devices don't have.4. This has best features for timer tasks.5. Scheduling is much more advanced in alexa app.6. If you say turn on light in front of your kitchen echo dot it will turn on only kitchen lights. so you don't have to be specific like turn on kitchen lights like google home.(you need multiple echo devices for this as obvious)So forgot about google home and just buy it."
68,Indian Tech Advice,I Gave 4 out of 5 Star,4.0,"This is the first Echo I have owned. So far I am loving everything that it does from to do lists to news updates and linking my calendar to playing music. It is very convenient and hopefully in the future I will buy more products for it to control like my thermostat and lights. That being said I am wondering why in the world, it being an amazon product, does it not control my amazon fire stick! This is so fustraiting and I hope that amazon will come out with an update soon that will allow the echo to have this option! It seems like it can literally control everything except for the fire stick. This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars."
69,Damien Ray,Muffled Alexa voice,3.0,Speaker is good for news and music to some extent But it is worst when Alexa speaks. She sounds muffled and its difficult to understand especially when fan or ac is on The Equalizer wud not manage Alexa's speech it's only for news music etc. Very inconvenientI have 3 echo devices and homepod but Alexa is supercool as an assistant. Problem is only with echo dot 3rd gen. You can go for better echo models. I wud recommend to test it out first then make a buying decision
70,Hari Om,üò§ After 3 months!üëáüèª,4.0,"After 3 months here are the things which I found.Works better if you have connection of minimum 20 mbps.I have started to get few bugs or software issue.Alexa listens sometimes by itself and says, 'sorry, I don't know that.'Sometimes songs stops playing in middle by itself.It doesn't recognise voice even after activating it many times.After command it doesn't follow.Disconnects and reconnects network by itself.The sound has decreased, now at volume level 3 I can't hear music properly after 3 meters range. (Have same background noice of fan/Vehicles)Amazon please send a software update which solves these.Thanks!"
71,Naveen Kottamasu,Worst quality packaging materials,1.0,I brought two speakers on a sale. Waited for a few months to install when we move to our new home. And placed them in a cardboard box which contains a lot of cardboard boxes of electronics. Termites are attracted to the amazon echo boxes and made a mess and ate almost all the three echo dot boxes. And most interestingly the remaining boxes are stood firm. I don't know what to do now. Please help me Amazon.
72,jd,Voice recognition/understanding not that good as it's build,4.0,"The Echo Dot 3rd Gen is comparatively good that than it's predecessor. The sound quality is improved, however there are two things that I would like to being to the notice of it's manufacturer or would say the developers rather. The bluetooth connectivity is no good. it's very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device. Now coming to the main part of the Echo : voice recognition or rather would say it's integration. The Indian voice is a disaster. Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words. Half disappointed, else it's good."
73,Amazon Customer,This is like fishing by Amazon. Protect yourself,1.0,"Don't buy this product if you are not a Amazon prime member.This will work only prime members.I was happy to hear the voice of Alexa that's it. After that what ever I command to Alexa only reply is, this is for prime members.Expect whether report this device don't deliver anything.Planning to return it tomorrow.Please don't get into traps like this.Today they are telling to be a prime member tomorrow they may say upgrade it by paying some money.Thanks Amazon for trapping me.

75,utk787,A big flaw for indian market,1.0,"Using a proprietry power connector for power supply is a big flaw for indian market, where power outage is common, I have my speakers and modem connected with a ups and i am forced to keep alexa at the same place where it doesnt pickup my voice most of the time.

76,Nagaraj M,Bluetooth connection get disconnected automatically,4.0,"Scenario:Connect your iPhone11 with JBL Go and Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation via blue toothBoth device should be connected.

The problem is not observedIf only Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation only connected to the phone everything works fineThe same problem is not observed with iPad Mini and Android phone"
77,ashok,unique product,5.0,Product is good but if a perforated box had been given then it would have been good so that we could have ensured that there is no dust entry and when we operate it because of perforations sound should not be a problem and also the box should have a provision to insert the plug.In this way we could have kept in a place where there is no dust entryMay be for futureregards
78,Kumar,Way to go.,3.0,"Well, it certainly does few things but way to go. I don't understand with all the money and talent Amazon has, why they didn't provide simple skill to under stand simple commands like Enter/Select, Go up, Go down etc. so that we can use it proper remote.Pros:1. Lots of fun. You can roast your friend by setting simple routine which can be activated by customized voice phrase and it will respond with your customized messages.2. You can control your TV, FireStick etc but in a limited way.3. Can ask for time while half asleep...it provides many other simple features and some of them are useful too.Cons:1. Doesn't recognize Select, UP, Down and other navigation command. So cannot replace you fire TV remote.2. Misses the command now and then.3. Difficult to give voice command while there are other sounds around like if you are watching TV of listening to music. That's very frustrating as you cannot pause video if sound coming from TV is high."
79,Amit,Distorted sound,2.0,"Within 3 months of purchasing the sound has begun to distort, even at 5 or 6 level I can here unusual sound. I don't know what to do. My return window is already closed.Secondly, song searching on Gaana app is very poor. I am very fond of Riya's Retro, but Alexa can search only season 1 and moreover it doesn't recognize different episodes of season 1 either. Means if you have already gone through 4-5 episodes of Riya's Retro and want to listen to the next episode, you have to start from episode 1 and then have to skip the episode you have already gone through. It takes hell lot of time to play the next episode after you give the voice command ""Next"".AMAZON SHOULD REPLACE MY ECHO DOT."
80,inspiration,Good speaker for songs only.,4.0,"I'm very happy with my purchase.Initially it feels little bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it.Later on talking to Alexa becomes a part of your daily life.‚úÖThings which I like the most are stated below:üëçThe sound quality is very good.üëçYou get good depth of sound.üëçYou can ask any random questions to Alexa.üëçIt can speak and understand Hindi and English languages.üëçIt does play all musics from all languages.üëçIt can tell jokes.üëçI also played KBC with Alexa.‚ùåThings which I don't like are:üëéSometimes it is unable to understand what you said.üëéMost of time Alexa reply ""Sorry"" because she don't know the answers of our command/questions.üëéIt is a good music player but poor assistant.üëéIt plays certain songs again and again and doesn't let you skip.üëéYou have to set a play list in your phone or device from which you are operating Alexa.

81,Darayus E.,The future is now!,5.0,"Simply great product. Well built and very worth it. The voice recognition is great and works as intended most of the time. It keeps getting better as you use it. The sound really surprised me for its size. It's definately not a premium sound but it's still very bassy and loud, and full volume there is noticible disturbunce. The home automation part is what really makes this worth it though. I have my lights, tv and ac connected (using oakter remote) and ofcourse it's also an alarm, an intercom, a music player, a smart assistant and so much more. Life changing tech this is. I also like that you can command it in hindi and english. The conversations to be had are funny and almost natural. Software updates can/should make it even better. Wish it also had battery back up though, that's its biggest flaw. Soon I'll connect many other electronics in my house to alexa by way of smart switches."
82,R Krishnamoorthy,Good product,5.0,Very useful to eradicate the lonely feeling at all times. Can hear any type of songs what we like.
83,Swapnil Amritkar,My Office is now smarter.,5.0,"Works seamlessly.No issues so far.Never ignored what I said.Controlls AC, Computer Power, Lights, Music, etc. I'm so happy that I've an assistan that doesn't need any salary."
84,Digital Panache,Good device for the price,4.0,Great service at a great price. Thank you Amazon.The voice recognition is pretty good. But for this price you get a speaker quality which is decent. Not really so great. You can take it around with you wherever you go. We like to keep it in the hall which is large but it works power pretty well and covers the whole hall. The volume is loud enough for a big room for sure.
85,Anmol,Review after 2.5 months usage. It's a great purchase for me.,5.0,"I felt the sound quality is great at the price of 2249 during sale. The alexa integration is really good with all the amazing alexa skills available in echo dot. The voice recognition is average coz when the volume is above 5 , alexa couldn't recognize the wake word as the music is loud. So, we would require to shout to let her hear the wake word. I hope this might be resolved in the new (4th) generation as the sound will be focusing in 1 direction rather than 360 degrees, this is what i feel through looking at the design. The response time is good but can be improved in thr next generation yet to be released. Overall, this device is worth the purchase at regular price and during the sale it becomes much more worthy at the price of 2249. There are many hidden features in alexa which are not known by the majority customers like explicit filter, treble base and mid-range regulator, talk slow, talk fast, follow-up mode, sing a song, feedback, Horoscope, movie dialogues, quotes, Translation,  excellent mind and strategy games, kids games and fun games like Shadow game, Akinator, Bulls and Cows, Guess the number, Music mania, Yes Sire etc. and many more fabulous features. Please do a little search on Google about Alexa Skills and who knows you may be able to discover some great hidden features or a new feature. Also, at regular intervals, please do ask your alexa to check for software updates and update the device. It will allow you to enjoy new features with every update. Although, Alexa may not be the greatest invention but it is definitely the sweetest invention and yes it's becoming smarter everyday. Alexa is not comparable to other devices like google home, google nest, apple homepod, etc. as they have different features and different price segments. If you need a wide range of features and skills for daily use and fun, Alexa devices are the perfect choices. Believe me, even with those flaws i mentioned, Alexa will be a cheer. Just go for it."
86,NISHKARSH KRISHNATRAY,MUST BUY PRODUCT,4.0,"If you‚Äôre in the market for a cheap wireless speaker that can make calls, control your smart home and play the occasional song or two, the Amazon Echo Dot is easily one of the best smart speakers on the market for you ‚Äì even better than the Google Home Mini in terms of call quality and music playback."
87,RAJITH R.P,Be sure to buy it,5.0,"The device is quite unique and affordable. It has 4 mics and a really good speaker. You can set alarms, remainders and literally listen to every song. It uses less data while plugged in and about 100mb per hour to play songs and books. That means it literally uses less than 1-3gb per month. First of all Amazon has one of the best Customer Care services and customer friendly policies."
88,Yedu007,Definitely a deal breaker. !!,3.0,"I got the device and wipro smart bulb for 2k on freedom sale which I think is too good deal.Sound quality of the speaker is awesome.Very loud and Good amount bass it produces to fill the room.Software is not that great and voice recognition is very poor.Sometimes it won't responds.Responses are very limited and most of times it doesn't responds at all make me go mad.You can create routines of your like, editable in Alexa app.Aux connectivity helps you to connect with your home theater."
89,Manesh Kallil,Alexa is not efficient to play any malayalam songs,1.0,"Writing again since I am totally unsatisfied with Alexa and it became a useless item for me . Unable to add skills pertaining to choice of music . When i bought Alexa, lot of expectations , but it is not at all impressive on various areas, like when I ask Alexa to play malayalam songs , based on movies,singers,by song name, it is always gives an answer sorry I could not see any song. Same stands with Tamil and to an extend hindi songs as well.Google Home is much smarter and better choice than Aelxa. I strongly suggest if Amazon is not fixing this basic issues and needs of many in India, you may always got a better option 'Google Home'."
90,Rahul,Magical experience and awesome product no doubt,5.0,What a product.. U think of a song and say it.. Alexa actually can play the exact song to the 100% accuracy.Sound quality is awesome with this small sized powerpack. Romantic and slow songs music are just lovable. Although if u like badhash or some hip hop music. U can use an additonal speaker and connect this to it..Mics are quite sensitive and can take orders from other room. Only at high volume u need to yell still not but a concern though.Product build quality excellent.Just an amazing product. U will sure love it.Day 10 and still exploring it. My kid loves to interact with it and ask almost anything and he is excited.
91,Pravesh Bhardwaj,Pack a punch!,4.0,"Superb AI device coupled with great speakers. The first impression might seems like underpowered, but the sound quality & volume packs a punch. Children love it. It is able to understand most of the stuff & respond quickly. Mostly depends on amazon music for the songs. Only point is, if it can have battery back up, would have been truly awesome."
92,Praveen Tyagi,My first Smart Speaker,5.0,My first Smart SpeakerThis was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English
93,Praveena,A dumb voice assistant in modern times,1.0,"I ordered echo dot hoping it will help me in organizing the daily routines and provide responses to day to day questions especially for kids. Later came to know , most of the features lack the basic intelligence. Alex doesnt understand the context most of the times. you cant ask a question which is linked to a previous query/answer. Many times it tries to find a song only. !!! It acts desgned for a music playbox most time.Getting a song played out that we intent (sung by my fav singer) is almost no way in many cases. Reminders - voice level cannot be set so I end up creating Routines instead. Many times my kid asks queries and it gives foolish answers. There are no good stories we can get to hear unless we pay for another subscription other than  the prime. !!!.  The definition it gives is mostly from wikiepedia which it thinks as source of truth.!!.Many times I felt throwing the device to the floor. In a nutshell , this is a dumb musical player created by Amazon SW team. There is no element of intelligence to it. They just integrated it with routines and we can do those  routines  and play the song (the one , that it decides) . Amazon product team ihasnt improved this device at all in the new generation model."
94,Thilak,Noisy sound after 20 days,1.0,"I bought this on Jan 25 and it was working great, the voice recognition is good, alexa software sucks and sound quality was also good (not for long). Now its 20 days and the speaker started creating buzzy sounds. At the beginning it was low, but as the time passes, the buzzing sound is also increased. Won't recommend it happily to someone."
95,ARUN KUMAR J,"Too worst to bad it's just entertainment play songs for kids, nothing any use",1.0,"Don't waste your money, it's just fun toy like that, if you talk local language then it's just sorry I don't understand and I don't know. It's only in Hindi and English language only and playing songs, there is no local language news also, it's to worst to bad don't buy and don't waste your money"
96,Raj Sutradhar,Good,5.0,"Good product by Amazon,  very intelligent and responding also loudness is good you'll don't need any other speakers if the size of room is medium or small. Sound quality is good bass is ok. Answers thing correctly.Cons is ... sometimes if you're playing song with full sound & you're not close to the device then you have to shout.& You have to say things properly if you want alexa to work properly.Very entertaining device which you can use in different good ways n works... it helps alot.. Go for it if you're getting this in a good price.. otherwise go for 4th gen that one have very good quality speakers."
97,Arpit,Smart but not enough,4.0,"Alexa is good in understanding the Indian accent and covering Hindi-English language , it does the job of voice assistant in terms of managing devices around... I tried controlling my Denon AVR X2500h with Alexa, it does the basic task of paying song, changing volume, but can't change the music mode etc. Similarly I can control my Airtel Internet TV set top box once set-top box is swith on, it can not swith it on or off.So it gets the work done upto certain extend but not completely.The biggest problem which is see with Echo devices is that it can not get the information from web though it is connected to internet always, for every thing to do it needs skill.Ideally it should go to web to find some basic answers instead of saying ""I don't know"".If anyone wants to use it just for playing music then this is one of the best smart speaker available in market in given price."
98,Ram,Voice recognition is not good,3.0,I was writing this review after three weeks of usage. I like sound quality in this echo device and very portable device.I dislike voice recognition is not good and whenever I turn on this device for first time it's not connecting to internet need to reset or start it again which makes us irritating everytime.Alexa has integrated to more things but some of the integration not working well.My rating for this product will be 2.5/5
99,Vi√üin Thomas,Do not By Any Amazon product,1.0,Its a absolutely cheating for the customer. If we buy any amazon product . Definitely we want to buy amazon prime members also. In this case if any song want to play absolutely need amazon prime membership otherwise we cannot play music through any other app. No Google Apps are not working through amazon alexa. If anybody want to amazon Alexa . Go For GOOGLE HOME. Its have everything. And also free cost for all App
100,Revanth,Amazing sound quality. Amazing features. Slight issue with connectivity,5.0,Pros.1. Sound quality considering its compact design2. Compact. Box is also pretty small hence good to carry even when you travel.3. Great features with lot of additional apps or featured addons4. Does pick up most of the commands very easilyCons1. Intial connectivity took lot of trail. Even though the internet is very fast.Tips.Place it on a wooden table for better bass delivery
101,Akhil P Walia,Great as a Smart Hub and Voice Assistant,5.0,"I did a lot of research and after much deliberation, I finally decided to go with Echo dot Gen 3 over Google Nest. I have to say, I am totally loving this. I have connected it to my Smart TV, Fire TV, Wipro Bulbs, Camera and Smart Sockets. Overall, I am satisfied and the device is working as expected. The only minus point is that the power cable is using old-style pin connector instead of mini USB which is more a universal standard."
102,N.A.,Poor Quality,2.0,"Looks like its quality is deliberately deteriorated to boos echo dot 4th Gen sales.- It has a problem picking up voice commands unless I shout on top of my voice- After it hears alexa, it gets stuck at times and doesn't respond to anything and just keeps blinking the blue light- Even the sound quality sounds artificialNot happy with the speaker"
103,Som Limbu,Great for Kids!,5.0,"My Nephew is in love with it. At first he was surprised how it could answer all his never ending questions. Now he is so attached with it and guess what we are also relieved now, we don't get so bugged by his all sorts of questions now. Some we knew some we had to research. Now he can himself find out his answers and use it as a PDA for himself.Update:I ordered second one for my another nephew's bday. Its great product to introduce technology to the kids."
104,janak,Device is great but I GOT BORED!,4.0,"This is a good device (or should I say a Toy). It works exactly as promised. So, no complaints over there.BUT,This is more like a toy to me. The day when I bought this I was very excited to use it but eventually my interest faded and now it is just lying around the house. I use it some times to listen to music nothing more because kab tak aap use weather ya news puchoge ya bate karoge. I even have a fire TV stick to pair it with and use voice commands but it is not perfect search so I end up using remote. I even have a wipro smart bulb but the story remians the same.YOU WILL EVENTUALLY (1 WEEK IN MY CASE) GET BORED WITH THIS TOY."
105,sada,"When it comes to automation,  this device is going to be helpful for beginners",4.0,This is able to recognize Indian accent really well and the drop in function is helpful for calling the device to talk to the person near the device.  The smart plug can be scheduled and works seamlessly. Cons would be the sound is kindLoud but lacks clarity. The mid frequency needs to be tweeked for optimum clarity and rarely the device doesn't respond when we call Alexa
106,nikhil sachan,A perfect companion,5.0,"I love my echo dot device. There some things, which are really good like whisper command. I am using google mini for last 1 year, it is also really good but some diff are really noteworthy. I am living in hostel so I don‚Äôt want to disturb my neighbour student in night when I command my echo ,which is far from my bed to switch off my light. In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time.  The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light ,  google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ‚Äù switching on Nikhil Syska bulb‚Äù during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google ‚Äú switch of the light ‚Äú it will shout back ‚Äú switching off Nikhil Syska bulb ‚Äú but echo dot just say ‚Äúok‚Äù which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch üôÑ.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me . It remind me if my order is coming today.Portability - it‚Äôs shape makes it less beautiful but good in portability. It fits in my bag so conveniently  just ignore the dangling cable."
107,vinay,Ok,3.0,"Not happy it's an ok product  as it does not catch things fast, to add on Amazon prime would have worked better if it sinks in with you tube and Google along with added new features ( off old and new).Another annoying thing is it keeps giving the entire description (ex - song or any movie ) which cannot be put off.It's goes not have want I want."
108,Sneha Yadav,Do not ever buy this,1.0,"Dont fall for this. Though it feels good when it plays few songs however in most of the cases it wont recognize your voice. Also, at high volumes, you will keep on shouting Alexa, Alexa and it wont hear you.Just a stupid toy, may be for kids"
109,Pritam,Output via 3.5mm jack is very poor,2.0,"I just don't want to integrate it with anything in my house as it doesn't sound clear via built in speaker and 3.5mm output jack, I brought it for listening music, podcast and GK but due to poor audio clarity it is still not in plugged in state in my home, it is just sitting on table without it's adapter plugged in."
110,Ankit,Bad product,1.0,It worked good for about a month. But after that it started hanging. Now most of the times it doesn't recognise my words and many times it gets hanged while playing music. Wipro bulb camed with it also has the same situation. I keep its switch on but Alexa says that bulb is offline. Total waste of money.
111,NC,Unrelated but necessary to know about AMAZON'S after sale and warranty service. Be warned.,1.0,"This is the second time that I have had to purchase this product, my first echo dot device stopped working and since it was not in warranty I was advised by AMAZON to send it to their CTDI team which handles out of warranty devices. My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare. The CTDI team is impossible to contact, they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work. After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a  new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem ."
112,Vijay pratap singh,Review after a year usage,4.0,Product was good but it was only for few months? After 1 year as warranty expired it stopped working suddenly and not even showing power sign or a blink. No idea how to get it repaired. Any option for trade-in for this please let me know
113,sai prakash,Vice recognition not working.,2.0,I got the echo dot on offer and excited to use but voice recognition is not working tried to restart and done troubleshooting steps but no use. Placed for replacement lets see what happens.The main feature of the app echo dot is alexa but for me that is not woorking.
114,Pranshul,Read full review please,2.0,"Wnna buy only smart speaker--googleWnna get an amazon atmosphere(prime,amazon music,fire tv etc,)--alexaFor a smart speaker its not that smart, nothing works without activating a skill and skills set (trust me not that great, sukhaa pada h yaar) if you only want a smart speaker üîä and you are heavily invested in amazon prime and fire tv stick like gadgets and you have other smart compatible devices and you need the help of amazon services very often only then go for it. Until used with amazon family its good but, if you want only a smart speaker then go for google home mini nest version you will be very happy. Alexa is just a very weak ai in front of google"
115,Robin Raj,Great product with nice feature but repair of this product is not possible in India,4.0,"The product is really good and works fine as per the expectation.Though the proble is once it gets hardware proble as in my case due to fluctuation in power, speaker of my device got damaged. Then I had sent it for repair but in india they can't open the device and repair it hece I was offered to buy refurbished decice at 2000 with just 3 months warranty hence it is like almost paying for a new device with just 3 month of warranty rather than 12 months. Again once 3 month is over for the refurbished device you are on your own if device gets any fault. Hence the vecious cycle of buying refurbished item or new device will continue as there is no option to repair in India.  Hence over dependency on this item will invite this unavoidable vecious circle."
116,Anuj Sharma,"Alexa, do I need you?",3.0,"I truly don‚Äôt see the point behind Alexa or any smart speaker for that matter.I finally bought it coz it was on offer during sale and I just wanted to see what the fuss was about and I was right, there‚Äôs nothing great about a smart speaker.There‚Äôs nothing much you can do with it and the charm & novelty wears off quite soon. More of a gimmick than an actually useful gadget.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the product is good but I really don‚Äôt see its utility. Buy with your own wisdom & utility."
117,Pratiksha,Wonderful,5.0,It was a great deal at that price.. the smart bulb and echo dot pair perfectly and works fine and all other smart devices are easily recognised by Alexa app and there was no hassle in connecting devices and using echo dot. The combo is great.
118,chaitanya,Using it since 2 plus years. Simple and awesome,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I have been using it since years.Perfect home smart speaker. Sounds crisp and listens carefullyPair a couple of them and get the awesome stereo effect as well .Can be a smart speaker in kitchen , working desk stereo , bed side night audio device. You name it it delivers.Loved this product through out the usage"
119,Pompi,Read this while you decide,5.0,"The room has converted into a smart home. But it is a costly affair. First of all you need a wifi connection then you need all smart acessories or appliances to pair with Alexa such as Smart Plug, Smart Bulb, IR Blaster(require in case of non-smart appliance like AC). Overall it gives an esteem feeling. The echo dot 3 is good. But I expected a beter sound from the device."
120,Aninda Majumder,Modern living essential,4.0,"Excellent product to have for a modern living.Only problem is that it is hooked to Bollywood for some reason I am unable to figure out. Most of the song it plays are from Bollywood even if I ask to play something else but not specific.Barring this, it is an excellent product."
121,Abhishek,Buy it without second thought.,5.0,"This is one of the best speakers you will get own. The response is improving everyday and the skills are polished continuously. Don't go by the reviews of negetive people as they have a bad accent and then blame it on the speaker, however Hindi is also supported now.Just buy it when you get a deal as I got a free bulb with it.You have to spend a little if you want to be at par with the technology. Since Jio Savan is fully supported you therefore need not get the prime membership in case that is what you are afraid of."
122,Amaljith,Not upto the mark,3.0,"While comparing with google assistant, the AI is far better in google assistant and the command pickup capabilities and other execution patterns are good in google assistant. But the voice bass and loudness is good in alexa. The lighting illumination and looks are impressive in alexa. But job wise Google assistant nailed the industry withe google's own AI features."
123,Das,Good Product,4.0,"Database need to update, sometimes gives wrong answers, sometimes unable to understand the question and start giving different subjects description. I would like to suggest Amazon to update the Database urgently. one more thing the microfone is getting weaker than when i purchased."
124,Chandru,Awesome product,5.0,"My son has been asking for a long time. However we weren't buying. This time, we decided to buy. It's an awesome product. we are astonished by its voice recognition capabilty. It's picks up right songs with minimal inputs.We have integrated it with fire stick also.No regrets...I recommend a buy ...Happy Alexaing :)"
125,Gaurav Kumar,WRONG INFORMATION about Echo Dot,1.0,"I ordered this product because it shows in web description as ""Echo Dot (3rd Gen)"".But when I connected to it with my alexa app, it shows Echo Dot ""2nd Gen"" instead of ""3rd Gen"".I am feeling like cheated."
126,Krunal Wankhede,"Great smart home accessory, deliveres what it promises",5.0,"A great device to have, makes your life easier, combined with other smart devices it makes your home a smart home,Coming to the product,Build quality is very good, looks great, anti slip base keeps it in place, sound is also crisp clear, sufficient base and enough volume,Connectivity is also good,Cons:- needs constant power supply, would have been better if it had battery backupSuggestion to amazon:If it could be used as bluetooth speaker"
127,RAGHU,Cheated and worst pick up service,2.0,"I got a faulty product. The lights were on for 5 mins..then all went off..there was no orange light...totally dissatisfied in 30 mins....Return Status: I applied for return on the same day that the product was delivered. The next day, i got a sms stating pick time was scheduled between 7 am to 7 pm which was ridiculous. Would the Amazon pickup service want someone to be in home for the whole day, just for receiving the pick up guy? I waited till 3pm and left for other imp service. Had an sms sent at the morning hrs about the approx pickup time, it would have been more meaningful. Totally, cheating and lethargic."
128,Rohit Verma,Good as a novelty for kids,1.0,"Horrible music sound. Only good for speeches or weather reports, not for music. Bluetooth connectivity is a pain if you have multiple devices. Stationary use only (no battery). If you go and plug in another room, for example from living room to bedroom you have to start connectivity again from scratch. Alexa software is ages behind Google voice. I am returning this product. Good for a novelty, although you can get better items to show off for that price. Could not even recognize Gurgaon. Don‚Äôt be fooled by 3rd generation... just some more fancy lights. If the price drops after you buy it and take it somewhere else. You are basically left with price difference hanging around your neck! Rip off. Great for kids though!"
129,Ankit,Very disappoint,1.0,"Not happy,It's work with limited 2or 3 app.It's not work with you tube and other search engine.Many songs are doesn't understand it.Overall not good experience"
130,John,Brilliant Product,5.0,"I got this one during the Prime day sale. I have used this for a month now and below is my review.Pros:1. Excellent Speaker - both as a standalone speaker and smart device (at the price point i got on Prime day)2. Alexa - Has almost no trouble in recognizing voice and very rarely does it falter, plus integration with Amazon ecosystem - You can place order, track deliveries and also receive news updates all via Eco dot.3.  Bluetooth - Can even use this as a blue-tooth speaker for iPad / Phone . Does a great job (needs power source though)Cons:1. Portability : A removable USB cable on adapter would have enabled much wider usage (battery bank power?)2. One command at a time - It cannot execute 2 or 3 commands in one go - Like switch on the light, & play music will need you to say ""Alexa"" 2 times.  Can be a bit abrupt at times - in starting and stopping music etc.Verdict : Brilliant smart speaker for home use at a great price point."
131,Mahesh,"Very good product, worth buying",5.0,"First thing i am very happy with amazon deliverythe product is at my hand before 24hrs after I ordered even I am not prime member, it was very good and super fast delivery compare than any othersHere my review after using it 1 weekEcho dot (alexa)  the product is in good condition,features are very smart, you can play variety of any music which are in your mind, alexa can tell you whether info, news, reminder, alarm on single statement spoken by you, feel smartness while talking to alexa, My 3 yr son also like it while speaking with Alexa... he ask to play songs which he likes most... overall i am very happy with this product"
132,Bala Subrahmanyam,"It just a ""Ribo-for-Music"" "" Jai Patalabhairavi",5.0,"Very useful one, Luckily no Ads disturbs the Stotralu,Mantralu,Songs so can enjoy uninterruptedly. Audio Quality need to Improve, of course, in  Hugh volume it may OK, but we may not enjoy "" the High Volume Fir the sack of quality. More functions surprises us. Thank to the invented team."
133,kawaljit kaur,Disappointed,1.0,"I m sorry to say that I was disappointed with this product. I know alexa is v popular with ppl who want to listen to songs. I wanted to listen to kirtan only but cudnt listen. It always played something different. Moreover, it was not linked to YouTube. Had no option but to return the same..."
134,Siddhartha,"Great speaker, average voice assitant",4.0,"Common guys you need to fix the amazon music search results, I search for a song and it gives me a different results and I cant find the original song until I specifically mention the singer. Its very annoying when YouTube music works flawless, sadly there is no inter-compatibility with each other.Also why cant I change the voice, it sounds so robotic, make a better alternative, its one thing that's keeping me away from making it my default voice assistant.Everything else is just great. Sound has much more depth. Google home mini is tuned for better vocal response while echo is for music"
135,Vidyadhar Misal,Few improvements needed,3.0,"They need to provide battery backup so that we can carry it anywhere.It needs to play songs randomly also like YouTube, instead of asking it to play. It might have this feature and I may be unaware so second comment can be ignored if it has it.I returned it as I wanted to play songs in my bathroom where there is no electric connection."
136,Muhsin,It's totally worth it.,5.0,"I bought it for 3500 for 2 echo dots and 1 bulb. For this price its totally worth it. I really enjoyed using it and my sis has a toddler who is easily pacified using alexa light controls and songs (we have bought costlier toys but it's alexa who mostly saves the day). So for my home, It already did more than I paid for.üòåüòåüòå"
137,Sorrow,Get google,1.0,"The setup process is so tedious and when i tried to change network it just doesn't work. This isnt setup its like open setup and you might have a chance to set up the device successfully! Hurry! It really is so bad i am connected to amazon wcp network for hours Nothing happens, alexa just goes out of setup mode thats it. I cant do sheet. Tooooo bad and tiring and waste of time."
138,Devanshu Srivastava,All you need to know about Amazon Echo Dot,5.0,"Superb purchase made during the Great Indian Festival Sale by Amazon. I feel so good that I made a right decision of buying this wonderful product by Amazon. It's a small speaker but the sound is enough for a medium to large sized room. It connects with my home Wifi seamlessly.This smart speaker supports voice recognition and it can recognise my voice which is truly amazing.Sound quality is very good and it has a nice clear sound which is loud enough.Alexa integration is the main feature of this product, which is why it's a must-buy for every smarthome.The speaker connects to all my smart devices, namely, Amazon Fire Stick, Wipro Smart Bulb, Wipro Smart Batten, and Wipro Smarthome. It makes my life so easy!Alexa has a lot many supported apps and the number is increasing everyday. You get a lot of interesting apps to use with Alexa. For example, you can order Uber cabs, ask time, play a game, listen to music and what not. This speaker truly leverages the power of Amazon Alexa."
139,shashank,Totally Amazed,5.0,"This is just awesome.There are so many things we can do with this device and that made me wonder that why this is so cheap.I got a smart bulb with the device in just 2500 rs.Now I control my bluetooth speaker, my tv(firestick) and my bedroom light with my voice commands.This is fun for my 4 years old kid too and Alexa tell stories to him.The voice recognition is very good and the proof is that even my kid's commands Alexa recognise."
140,anilkumar,Worst software and dont blame cusomers,1.0,"Voice is not recognising what ever we say something like play songs from ABC movies or storieseven we restart device multiple times, could you please help on thisVoice is not recognise and Even I changed default music to amazon music app when I ask Alexa play music from amazon music it's not recognizing tried multiple times its not working can help meWorst software desinged sont blame customers just providing like switch off lightsand ola bokking..etc because whatever we spoken alexa is not listen even it contains builtin jio songs. Lets say examples alexa play  palasa 1978 movie telugu songs..but default its going default liat songs are playing from jio saavan insyead of what i given command... And even we created playlist from differeny music apps(jio saavan,spotify) but its not recognizing. with Ads you are providing whoever developed does they using this?

If you are thinking to buy it or not, then I'm sure that you will get thrill and enjoy after buying it. I was also thinking same but then I bought it for Rs.3000 during discount period. So, wait and buy it when it goes to price of Rs.3000 or below.Currently, it is Rs. 3500 but wait and I""'m sure that it will go down to Rs.3000 within a 1 or 1.5 month. Just wait and check regularly the price of this product (check daily atleast once).If you thinking to buy google home mini, then don't buy at all, I've experienced both. Echo dot is thousand times better that it. Google home mini don't recogine your voice well and can't perform e-commercial and play games activities."

144,mnvs,Its a great choice if its not a plug n play device.,4.0,"Everything looks good.sound quality and responsiveness to commands are perfect.Only negative is its a plug n play device ,in that price they should have provided battery in it and then we can carry everywhere we want with us and use it as a absolute bluetooth smart device.thats why im giving 4 star rating.whenver power is off or the supply stopped by turning the switch off by someone, u need to setup again for alexa dot to work, its such a hectic and irritating process and once it setup you cant move this device to someother place without turning the power supply off and need to reconnect the device."
145,Indian,"Great product, but still quite dumb",4.0,"Amazon echo dot is a great product in terms of its sound quality and overall entertainment value. But for practical use it is still quite dumb. For Indians we definitely need to set English and Hindi together. Also many common things it does in a dumbest way. Many Indian songs it doesn't understand correctly. Variations in news, scores, horoscopes, weather are just missing.Long way to go for this technology. In many ways google assistant is better. I hope that same device should allow marriage of all the technologies in this field."

¬†Thanks to Amazon for this amazing product at an amazing Price in this Great Indian Festival: I was lucky to get this Echo Dot bundled with Wipro smart bulb @1999 !Now the important thing : How to be able to use it in Hindi . First go and check the software version of ur echo dot from ur Alexa App in the smartphone ( go to the 'Device' menu at the down right corner in the app).  I have uploaded the pic of the updated software version till today 07.10.2019. Just command echo dot "" check for software updates"" . Echo dot will start updating ur software for a little time.Wait until a blue ring appears in ur echo dot. Don't prompt anything to the echo device during the update.After the update u can set the device language to Hindi (India) in ur device settings.I have uploaded a small video to show that it is really working smoothly.Hope this review will be helpful to people who wants to use it in Hindi like me."
148,Suman Kolay,This is for Seller - cloudtrail!!,4.0,"I order this product and the seller was Cloutrail, when I opened the sealed box from amazon it was ok, however the echo dot product box was double sealed.1.The actual horizontal seal was opened before and then the seller had sealed it with normal cello-tape as mentioned in the pic above.2.The manuals inside was not place properly inside the box, as I am 100 per sure this has been opened and used by seller.3. The charging cable of the adapter was in tangled state, and the binding rubber of the wire was not even inside the box.3. The plastic seal was not present in the device. (on the top of interface)4. Even while setting up, I had to reset it to complete the installationWhy did you sent a refurbished product when I ordered for a new one??I will make sure Amazon pays for this!!"
149,Abhishek Jain,Poor Sound Recognition,2.0,"Not sure if it is my device or a general issue but the speech recognition is not up to the mark. The device doesnt respond to my device's ""Wake up"" text and I need to shout at the top of my voice to make it react. Not cool."
150,Binosh,Now it is working!!,5.0,"Purchased Echo Dot (3ed Gen).connected ... but Alexa didn't respond very well. No songs, ( i have no prime membership). some times shows a rotating blue light. not answer any questions. the package was opened while dispatched.Alexa application also not responding in the mobile.something went wrong.. I sign in my account in Amazon and delete all devices. uninstall app from phone. reinstall all.. nothing help to overcome the issue.Now it is resting in the table, I am also resting.. , tired ...Then some one call from AmazonHe said the wifi was the culprit.. ( I am also noticed it )I reset the wifi account from ISP ( call and ask to reset my account)But there is no Gaana, Hungama etc in my music list ( only Amazon Music, Apple Music & TuneIn )after a while search in the net and by the help of the Amazon caller..

I remember the small piano or such devices our parents used to give us when we were 6 years old. Whatever you ask it has only few stereotype answers. Playing a desired song is the most irritating part. It never knows what you want to play, instead it plays some fixed song list no matter what you asked her play. Also it also doesn't have songs with filters such as genere, mood etc. My opinion ? DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.. your mobile is far useful to do things you expect Alexa can ..."
152,shorya srivastava,Very good device for 1st experience as a home device,5.0,Recieved the product in less then 24 hours from amazon with price of 2399 rs. I can say that it's better then gen-4. I have setup the device in my hall. And the sound it produces is immersive. Alexa integration is superb as well as voice recognition. Setup process is very simple. I also got amazon power plug and havels wifi bulb. I paired all three device in 2 minutes. And then it is ready to go. I can say that one should give it a try to have the experience of technology. Completely satisfied üôÇ
153,Vishal Shekar,Can't answer simple questions that Google can....,3.0,"The reason for 3 start review is, it can't answer simple questions that Google can answer. When there's music playing, I need to shout loud to tell it to pause. Sound Quality is decent but the microphone seems bad. Was happy with home automation commands....But felt absolutely disappointed with the answers."
154,KRISHNA,Pros and cons,3.0,Pros1. It explains Vocabulary2. for English and Hindi Songs ( that only specific to jio saavan or amazon music ) Cons1. It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 1.5 m2. It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs. It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music.3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while4. Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time. Every time u need to enter set up mode ( Orange Color light with pressing dot button ). It is better if we can directly change from app.
155,Sunil K.,Non Sense Alexa Product,1.0,"Interaction with Alexa quaility is very W roust...Alexa software is very bad..No Use ..compared to Google Voice.Compared to Phone Google Voice is better response and good result.Alexa not matured, No knowledge upgraded compared to google voice.Alexa Device is No Use compared to google voice in Phone.Mico is not good quality.Different answers for simple questions from Alexa.Alexa replay is not good.This device not good for playing for few days.. Fully boring with alexa replay.Waste of Money.We have to wait for New latest generation software for alexa until its waste of product."
156,Ashutosh T,Quality product with a variety of uses,5.0,Echo Dot 3rd gen is an absolutely amazing device. It works as expected and has great amount of features. Th sound signature is good and Alexa works 100pc of the time. Although there is room for improvement in voice recognition when there is too much noise in the room or fan is running and search results of Alexa also needs some improvements. Overall a great product at good price
157,Abhijit Rajak,My first Smart Speaker,5.0,Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English.7. Now Amit ji voice on alexa but Alexa sweet enough to entertain you.
158,Harshith kamble,BEST for SMART Homes.,5.0,"You can buy it with no hesitation. But my suggestion is the people who are looking to or having a SMART HOME like everything in your house is automated with Voice command it's good for you. And for the normal houses it's just act like a Bluetooth Speaker that's it somewhere around in a corner laying in your house. If you want to BUY it first convert your house like smart bulbs, tubelights, android TV, remote enabled fans, Ac's. Normal houses just a speaker that you can talk when bored for entertainment."
159,shubham bhardwaj,Sound quality good,3.0,"Eco dot 3rd gen . Some time not recognise conamds and skills.. company claim fully smart speaker.

Some time then i ask ""where is Mathura"" answere correct...but when i say ""how i go Mathura"" no route find by alexa eco dot 3rd gen.... More updates needed....may be...üòä"

¬†Never realised that Alexa was this amazing until I purchased one.If you have a proper WiFi connection at homeIf you have smart devices and controllable electronics Alexa is a must have device for you. Go for it. Over a month of experiencing the hands free way of performing multiple tasks Alexa has been an incredible device and software for my everyday use. The speakers are really great for the price we pay. Go for it.I have purchased 3 unites and over all this is worth it"
161,Amazon Customer,Absolutely worthed!!,4.0,Sound - The clarity is fantastic. It does provide a surround sound feel. The bass is great until volume 7 after which it starts jarring. Please don't expect it to fulfill a theatre or disc like experience!Voice recognition - pretty much spot on everytime!!Only drawback is no bluetooth option for aux capabilities!!
162,Nethaji ganesan,MOST DISAPPOINTING SUPPORT FROM CUSTOMER CARE,1.0,"i purchased the alexe echo dot device for my grand daughter 3 days bach. i was unable to set up the device .i and my son struggled for several hours for 2 days. then we called customer support. while they talk very sweetly they do not keep their promises . no mail is received . no return phone call as promised. we have to continousy follow up leavng all our other work. after paying 4000rupees this is a big punishment. the device cannot connect to the wi-fi. the customr support came to the conclusion that the device is DEFECTIVE , and will be replaced . i do not know when . i am keeping folded hands praying. THIS IS THE FATE OF ON LINE SHOPPING WITH AMAZON"
163,Avishek,Small yet powerful and helpful.,5.0,"I would like to take some time while explaining my experiences with Alexa.Initially, I was very skeptiCal about these devices, and I was manuovered by the feelings that these devices are just a marketing propaganda and there is no practical use of it. Adding to the woes is the electronic items from Amazon which is not a specialist in such items also magnified my negative images for such devices.My eleder brother ordered this device for his use and the lockdown offered me some time to spend with my family including Alexa device.  I am writing the review after regular two week use of the devices and my feedback is followingPros-Timely delivery by Amazon.Great packing.Easy to setup the device.Amazing sound quality, I was amazed to see that a pocket fitting devices can produce such loud and clear output.Very prompt reply from the device upon any request.Multi language support.Works very fluently with the mobile hotspot.Smart home integration is awesome.ConsAlexa gets upset sometimes as housewife's do. You just need to set it again.Final verdict- just go for it. It's a super device."
164,Sreenath D.R,Go for it,4.0,"Sound quality is good but not the best (you cannot expect more according to the price range)Sound quality : 7.5/10Responsive : 8/10, could have been better but it does the jobMusic : very less features when it comes to music many little things that's possible through phone is not available.Overall : 6/10.You can go for it, its not a necessity as most of the things is achievable through smartphone easily than this."
165,Amit,Good product,4.0,"I had Google donut but it failed miserably, Echo dot is much better ...however it doesnt recognize some questions. But nevertheless good device. But the smart bulb I got with it is very very tough to adjust with it through app, still havent been able to do it as the bulb instructions arent veryclear"
166,Mukul,Overrated product,3.0,"Overall product is ok. But I'm not happy with the price and Alexa integration. She can recognize your voice from approx 10m of a distance. However, the recommendations/ suggestions provided by Alexa is not satisfactory. I mostly listen to music and the choices she makes are inexact. I mean idk how she come up with lame songs. For example, i have asked for Hollywood songs, she sometimes starts playing bhojpuri songs üòïüòï, additionally i have asked her to repeat what i have asked and she replies the correct sentence, and that's more strange.Anyways, price comparing to product, price is too high i bought it for 2500 and i would be happy to buy it for approx 1500. But, more than 2000 is unacceptable for Alexa.Trust me, I regret buying this product. Also, it's not even wireless üôÑüôÑüôÑ. It's app is too heavy which makes it too slow and so on.If you earn Luke crazy money, go for it... It's good for show off. However, if you are that person who thinks before buying, DON'T. BUY. IT. Pls, save your money for better things."
167,manish punia,Stop bluetooth announcement,3.0,"The most frustrating feature of Alexa is the annoying announcement while connecting to Bluetooth. it does every time when it connects with the device and there is no way to disable it. People have been crying for years, while Amazon is not listening.Other than that it is much better in comparison to google home mini. In comparison voice quality and search too."
168,Puru,"Distorted bass/sound. Defected product received in Imphal,Manipur.",1.0,"This is my second purchase, the first one was bought in Noida. It was great. But this one, I got it delivered in Imphal, Manipur. The bass of the speaker is distorted, the sound is distorted. It is nowhere as good as the one I got it in Noida. Is Amazon trying to sell defected products in the north-east or something? It takes longer than usual to reach Imphal even tho I have a prime membership, on top of that, you're selling us defected products. Shameful. Now I'll have to wait for 10-15 days for it to get replaced. With the lockdown and all, who knows how longer it'll take. Extremely disappointed."
169,Rajdeep,A very handy tool in a busy life.,5.0,"A must have product in your room. It does understand English and Hindi questions and queries better than 'Google Home' and also the sound quality is excellent when compared. Bluetooth feature comes very handy and notification light-blinking is also a great way. Better build quality than the previous generations. Featured skills are also available on the Alexa app including the Alexa-calling and broadcasting features. Mic is also very responsive too. Bass of the speaker is sufficient for a medium-sized room. Only issue is that with the manual buttons on the top which ""for my taste"" looks very ugly. Although if looks are not the priority then it is THE BEST buy in the smart-speaker segment today."
170,Amazon Customer,Good. No Battery power. No charm,3.0,Like.Product is good. Integration with Amazon music is good.DislikeNo battery back up. So it occupies the power point. Not portable as well. Major disadvantage for the price paid. The same size of branded wireless speakers are far cheaper.
171,Bhuwan Kapani,Alexa understanding capacity is reduced.,3.0,Alexa doesn't understand the commands properly.I ask to Play Sainyoo Nee it Plays Sainya Ve.I ask to Play. It plays some other languages radio station which we don't understand.It is not able to recognise the Wipro Bulb.I am fed up with Alexa. I want to return it back. If Possible.
172,Arunav Das,I didn't like the sound signature,3.0,"I didn't like the sound signature, I had to reduce the Bass to 0 and mid and treble to 10 to make it suit my ears. The Alexa app is very sluggish. It's very well built, can recognise voice from distance, options are less as compared to google assistant."
173,Muthuselvam Konar,Amazing Smart Speaker & Superb Audio Quality.,5.0,"Best Smart Speaker I have bought , Got it a very good price during Amazon Great Indian Festival, got it for around Rs 2200 along with Smart Led Buld.Pros :1. Very Good build quality.2. Superb Design3. Amazing Audio Quality4. Very good audio songs collection.5. Helps is various smart task like controlling smart lights at home.Cons :1. Not portable like a Bluetooth speaker as it requires power and internet.Overall I am very satisfied with this product. I can recommend this if you are someone looking for a smart speaker with good sound quality."
174,Amazon Customer,Good buy if price is around 2000,4.0,I bought this in offer in 2290. I liked the product as the speaker quality is good for a bedroom size. The voice recognition is good. Overall the Alexa works fine but of course there are flaws in understanding of instructions by Alexa because artificial intelligence is still just the tip of the iceberg. I don't think it would have been a good buy if bought above this price.
175,RAJAGOPAL,Good hardware but poor software,5.0,"Its one of the finest smart speaker in indian market nd amazon prime 999rs per year subscription gives more benefits with music, video,etc When it comes to hardware it hav good sound which fills one smal room. Echo support more smart accessories thn google home nd apple homepod thats big thumbs up for Echoüëçüèº When it comes to software its lacks so much features. Google home ll give you more accurate answers and follw up conservation. Alexa properly dnt deals with follow up multiple questions. Amazon music dnt have more collections lik spotify, wynk. So overall good hardware with poor software. Needs to improve more in software. You need to plug in al the time because it does not come with battery option."
176,Brijesh Maurya,"Dont expect it to do wonders, its needs a other 10 yrs of work",3.0,"Well, good for kids but for the most part AI needs huge amount of work, dont expect smartness like google, it more of bluetooth speaker and there are better options available in this price range. My daughter likes to play around with Alexa with all kinds of unusual questions. Decided to keep it"
177,Ramesh Adhavaraju,"Good product, value for money",5.0,"Product is good, after using for a month, felt bad, I should have gone to 4th generation, few features are missing in it, just a suggestion should have added micro sd features too, to listen for some downloaded songs also. All features are good and working well, HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT."
178,Shaik shafi,Don't respond to commands even buttons not working,1.0,I bought it 2 days backI turn off charging during night when I plug again in morning it is taking time to connect and after some time it stops responding to commands and also it won't work with button also then I have to restart 2 times minimum
179,Nitin K,Good toy for kids,4.0,"All is good with this device, don't understand how tough it would have been to integrate a battery into it. Worse, the power adapter is not industry standard Micro-USB or Type C. Amazon's way of making people dependent on their proprietary power adapter, and eliminating chance of powering it with a power bank"
